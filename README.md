# ⭐ **GitHub Summary (Short + Professional)**

**This project demonstrates the implementation of Decision Trees and Random Forests using Scikit-learn.**
It covers data preprocessing, model training, overfitting control, feature importance analysis, visualization, and cross-validation.
A complete all-in-one script is included for easy execution.

### 🔍 Key Features

* Decision Tree Classifier
* Tree visualization with `plot_tree`
* Overfitting control using `max_depth`
* Random Forest Classifier (ensemble learning)
* Feature importance ranking
* 5-fold cross-validation
* Fully reproducible code

### 📚 Concepts Learned

* How decision trees split data
* Entropy, Gini, and information gain
* Bagging and ensemble methods
* Model evaluation and generalization
* Interpreting feature importance

### 🛠 Technologies

* Python
* Scikit-learn
* Pandas & NumPy
* Matplotlib
